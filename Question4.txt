Question #4: Checking for Uniqueness

Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean.

Example
Input: "hello"
Output: false

Input: "copyright"
Output: true


* Notes:
1. find a way to loop through the string
2. compare elements in the string to find if there are any matches or repeating ones
3. if there are matches, return false, if not return true
4. this one seems very similar to Question2, so I'll use a similar method, but just with a string and not an array

* Questions:
1. Will the string ever be more than one word?
2. Will the string ever be empty?
3. Does the elements have to take into account case-sensitivity?

* Thought Process:
-For this one, I find it to be very similar to Question2, so I will be using similar code, just adjusting it to be looping through a string instead of an array.

* First Try Coding it:
function unique(string) {
  let checked = ""
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
      if (j === i) {
        checked += string[i]
      } else if (string[i] === checked[j]) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return true;
}
